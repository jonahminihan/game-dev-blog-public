Strangely enough, the start to this journey was building a website; the website you're currently viewing. I started with my favorite React meta framework, Next.js, and started looking for inspiration on how the website should look. I had made a website with a glassmorphic design and was interested in exploring that some more. My first idea actually still exists on the currect site, but in a much less significant role. If you remember from the homepage, the week list consists of glassy cards in two columns. The initial idea was to make these cards the focus of the website and the main source of information. After the cards, I began searching for an interesting background that could show off the glassy cards that were meant to be the focus. The one I landed on was from --",(0,s.jsx)("a",{href:"https://wweb.dev/resources/animated-css-background-generator/",target:"_blank",children:"https://wweb.dev/resources/animated-css-background-generator/"}),"-- . Its a mostly one for one implementation, and I can't see much to improve about it. I changed the z-index and went on my way to trying to fix the clearly lacking glassmorphic cards. When I'm searching for inspiration I tend to end up at:"," ",(0,s.jsx)("a",{href:"https://dribbble.com",target:"_blank",children:"https://dribbble.com"})," ","I went under the landing page tag and started scrolling until I saw this image:"," "]}),(0,s.jsx)("a",{href:"https://dribbble.com/shots/18811600-Hero-header-concept",target:"_blank",children:(0,s.jsx)("img",{className:"mt-6",src:"week1-website-inspo.webp"})}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{className:"text-xl mt-6 font-light max-w-[1024px] ml-2 mr-2 text-center",children:"This is a post by Tran Mau Tri Tam (That's the account's name) and you can click on the image to view the dribble page on it. As you probably already noticed, this is not what mine ended up looking like, but it did give me an idea. I could try to have a simple intro title with a few cards to the right that detail what the website is about and I'd be golden. That's also not how it turned out... BUT CLOSE! I started with the cards to the side, checked how it looked on mobile (which I was anticipating being an issue with this layout), and made a custom mobile layout to put the cards under. I liked that layout, tried it on the desktop version and that's basically where we're at now!
